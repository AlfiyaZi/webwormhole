WebWormhole creates ephemeral pipes between computers to send files
or other data. Try it at https://webwormhole.io or on the command
line.

On one computer the tool generates a one-time code:

	$ cat hello.txt
	hello, world
	$ ww send hello.txt
	8-enlist-decadence

On another use the code to establish a connection:

	$ ww receive 8-enlist-decadence
	$ cat hello.txt
	hello, world

To install the command line tool:

	$ go get webwormhole.io/cmd/ww

This requires Go 1.13 or newer.

To run the signalling server you need to compile the WebAssembly
files first.

	$ make wasm
	$ ww server -https= -http=localhost:8000

To package the browser extension for Firefox or Chrome:

	$ make webwormhole-ext.zip

WebWormhole is inspired by and uses a model very similar to that
of Magic Wormhole.

It differs in that it uses WebRTC to make its connections. This
allows us to make use of WebRTC's NAT traversal tricks, as well as
the fact that it can be used in browsers. The exchange of session
descriptions (offers and answers) is protected by PAKE and a generated
random password, similar to Magic Wormhole. The session descriptions
include the fingerprints of the DTLS certificates that WebRTC uses
to secure its communications.

The author operates the signalling server at webwormhole.io, its
alias wrmhl.link, and a relay server. These are free to use but
come with no SLAs or any guarantees of uptime. They facilitate
establishing connections between peers, but do not handle any
transferred data in cleartext.

The protocol does not need to trust the signalling server to maintain
the confidentiality of the files transferred. However, the convenience
of using the web client directly on webwormhole.io comes at the
cost of having to trust it. To mitigate this this you can have
control over which version of the client you run by using the command
line client or the browser extension. The extension is identical
to the web client, but packaged for Chrome and Firefox:
